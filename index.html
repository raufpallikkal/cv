  <p>I am a metal chemist in an international TIC company called <a href="https://www.element.com/">element materials
      technology</a> located in Abu Dhabi.I have been working here for three years. i joined with this company
    as a sample prep technician in organic chemistry department in dubai branch of the company.
    I was recruited by the company for a big project.after 6 months the corona pandemic started to effect the uae.
    our project put on hold as the result.I was terminated from the company along some employees as the project was
    on hold.by the grace of allah company soon rerecruited me for an administrative assistant post while i was waiting
    for air ticket to india.my new job place was in ruwais where company has a site office working for <a href="https://www.etihadrail.ae/"> ethihad railway</a>
    project.I worked there for almost about one year.from there i started to think about carrier change.while working with
    microsoft excel my mind asked me to think about data science. I started to dreaming about me becoming a datascience
    a part from dreaming no real efforts happened from me to achieve my dream. i had been searching for other random jobs
    as i had thought i am already out of my field(chemistry).one day i found out that there is one vaccancy in element itself
    in abu dhabi. I tried for that post and i got selected as a chemist. i beacme happy. now i am work in abu dhani
    as a chemist. But now a days i started to think this is not my cup of coffee. i started to think about IT. i started
    to think about coding. now i trying to learn coding. i am trying to be a front end developer throug a udemy course.
    now here i am with hopes.... Insha allah.. allah is giving me the best.. and he will give me the best.. insha allah..</p>
